Python developer
----------------

-My name is Nikta Haji Ghafouri. It has been about three years since I first got acquainted with the Python programming language, and by being on the learning path (boot camp, university, projects and courses), I gradually fell in love with programming more and more. I was fascinated by this sweet and dynamic language with its wide applications.
-I am doing my bachelor's degree in computer science at Gilan University and I live both in Rasht and Tehran.

-I love team work and I have experienced three different and good job positions so far and I communicate well with people.
I am eager for dynamism and building, and the feeling of being efficient and progressing is one of the work values ‚Äã‚Äãthat is very important to me :)
-I'm passionate about solving problems to make the world a better place.
